## Emotion Detection Model

### Overview
This Emotion Detection model is designed to classify images of faces into different emotional categories. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze facial expressions and predict emotions such as anger, happiness, sadness, surprise, neutrality, disgust, and fear.

### How It Works
The model processes images through several convolutional layers, followed by pooling and fully connected layers. The images are resized to 48x48 pixels and converted to grayscale before being fed into the model. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled images, allowing it to learn the features associated with each emotion.

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow (for building and training the model)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - OpenCV (for image processing)
  - scikit-learn (for data splitting)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

### Requirements
To run the Emotion Detection model, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required libraries (can be installed via pip):
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow numpy pandas opencv-python scikit-learn
